## Project Description
This is a data visualization project for the analyzing and understanding real estate data across the United States. Data on this site is provided by Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. In this project, we visualize key metrics such as sale price, list price, inventory, homes sold over time and across geographies.


## Project Goals
 - For our audience to better understand their interested real estate market from a historical perspective using the trend charts.
 - Whether there has been an inflection point in the market from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market and vice versa.
 - The visualization gives a buyer or seller a quick sense of how much properties are going out for in his/her interested market and also the maximum price of properties in a given market.
 - The visualization can help to inform a buyer if it’s the right time to buy a property or wait a little.
 - It might also give a sign of recession for example looking at the over trend of the different metrics.

## Indended Audience
Our audiences are mostly real estate investors, current and would-be home owners and builders who are interested in knowing the states of real estate in their local community, city and/or state in order to make decisions.
